\subsection{Second law. Maxwell demon}
\paragraph{Second law} 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Heat transfers from warm to cold
	\item Carnot engine has maximal efficiency 
	\item Entropy of closed system can only increase, i.e. $\dot{S}\geq0$. To proof it, we need that movement laws are symmetric in time.
	\item It's impossible to get work from a single temperature source.
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Forbidding laws of physics }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Energy conservation. For
	 $$E = \sum_i \frac{p_i^2}{2m_i}+ \sum_i V(\va{r}_i) + \sum_{i\neq j} V_{ij}$$
	 This law prohibits existence of perpetuum mobile. It's equivalent to first law of thermodynamics.
\end{enumerate}

Each of $T_C$, $T_H$, performs work equals to change in heat $\Delta VP = \Delta Q$. Then total work is 
$$W_{total} = \Delta Q_c - \Delta Q_h$$
Carnot showed that
$$\frac{W}{\Delta Q_h} \leq 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h}$$

\paragraph{Maxwell demon}
Since $\frac{3}{2}Nk_BT = \frac{1}{2} \sum_i m\va{v}_i^2$.

Suppose we have a demon that can allow only fast particles from right to left and only slow particles from left to right. 

Alternatively, he can only allow particles from left to right, and thus change the pressure in two parts.
